## challenges I faced during developmentn  ##

-The first challenge was dealing with the background image in the headers.
-Creating responsive images also was another problem.
-There were difficulties at the beginning to track the code, then using comments was helpful to make it easy.
-Sometimes I donâ€™t see the changes that I did in the style sheet. then I discover that I forget to save the file.




  This code is `untitled list` that we use a lot .
 ```html
 <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/bassel.kotaish.cad/"><i
